Imagine if you had a steno keyboard where the keys could move on their own. This would allow you to read haptically in the same way you typed. And perhapse at up to hundres of words per minute. Far faster than braille. This is the idea of our project.

So far we have a prototype with LED lights rather than solenoids. In the future, we will replace these LEDs with electromagnets which can trigger the keys to jump up at you.
