## Screen readers
While we are still waiting for the rest of the components, we started looking at the computer side software that will be needed. Without some kind of screen reader this project is impossible. 
### BRLTTY
We chose to start with `Linux` and `BRLTTY`, because of the `tty` driver it has. The driver is relatively simple and can connect to any tty device. There is a problem with the driver though. It outputs in braille. We have been working towards making the driver output raw text and it is working to a certain extent, but it is not perfect by any means. There are still problems, where it weirdly combines 2 lines and in the future, if possible, we would like the driver to provide the ouput per word and not whole lines. This would mean that there would be no need to split the data coming into the mcu and that would be less strain on the chip.
### Other operating systems
For now, we have decided to solely focus on linux. There are screen readers made for other operating systems, which we will look into in the future.
