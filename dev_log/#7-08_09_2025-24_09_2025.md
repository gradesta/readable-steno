# Dev log #7 | 08.09.2025 - 24.09.2025

## Current phase of the project
The project right now is facing a breaking point in its development. While there are no drivers for communicating with existing screen reading software, there reading software itself is done. Currently, you supply it with text written in a serial monitor and then press `Enter`. The keys will start lighting up and when you press the correct keys, the next word/part of the word will light up.

## Next phase
In the next phase, a new protoype will be designed. This one will focus on the hardware side of this project and start implementing the moveable keys. The keys will be built like a small steel lever and be held-down or left up using electromagnets.
