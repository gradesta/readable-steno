# Dev log #4 | 28.07.2025 - 08.08.2025

# Software
During these 2 week we have focused on testing the LEDs and writing the firmware for controlling the LEDs and parsing cords. The current state of the project is that you can define a word in the `WORD` macro and the corresponding keys will light up on the board. Right now, it only works with single chord words.

# Set up
To test this, you will need the [pico-sdk](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk). The `CMakeLists.txt` file will work for you, but you will need to change the path to [pico_sdk_import.cmake](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/master/external/pico_sdk_import.cmake) based on where you have the repo cloned.

To choose a dictionairy for this, you need the json file. Then you will use the included python script to create a header file for the structure needed.
```
python3 translator.py name-of-your-file
```

In `led_driver.h` you can change the pins to suit your needs. The `keymap.h` header file only provides one function, which maps the individual characters of a chord onto the leds.

*Disclaimer*: Currently we do not have the controller socketed, that is why the pins in the file overlap with the pcb layout.
