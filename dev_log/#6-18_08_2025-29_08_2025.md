## Communication with BRLTTY
With the setup of `tinyUSB` we made the MCU look like a serial CDC device last time. This time we managed to send the text to the keyboard, which will then echo it back. After that `BRLTTY` and
the keyboard get into an infinite loop of reading and echoing. This will be worked out later. Another thing to look out for is that it looks like the echo comes back with at most one new character in the same line. This is because to `BRLTTY` every character written is a standalone display update. This will not be an issue when we will use the leds instead of echoing. `BRLTTY` also sends some initial bytes, which I counted and skipped. This may not work for you, because the amount of bytes in some packets can wary, but this should also be worked out in the next update.
