# Dev log #1 | 30.06.2025 - 11.07.2025

## Started prototype development
The first prototype board is mainly focused to develop software.
There are added LEDs to signal which keys make up the current word.

In the schematic the keyboard uses a standard keymap, it has 30 keys and is connected to a `rp2040 pro micro`. This board is designed to use hot swap sockets, so a broken switch is easily replaceable and low profile Choc switches.
For the LEDs there are 4 `SN74HC595N` shift registers, because there are not enough pins to control them individually.
The LEDs are connected in a way, where the shift register sinks the current on the cathode, while the anode is permanently
connected with 330Ω to the 5V Raw pin on the MCU. Between the Raw and Gnd pins a 100μF capacitor is placed, so it stabilizates
the current in the circuit.

### Optional
- Optionally you can use [pin sockets](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Female-Headers_HCTL-PM254-1-13-Z-3-0-C_C5159941.html) for the MCU, so it is not directly solder onto the keyboard
