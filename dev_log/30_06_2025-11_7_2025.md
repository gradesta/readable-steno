# Dev log #1 | 30.06.2025 - 11.07.2025

## Started prototype development
The first prototype board is mainly focused for software development.
There are LEDs to signal which keys make up the current word.

### Keymap

In the schematic the keyboard uses a standard keyboard matrix, it has 30 keys and is connected to a `rp2040 pro micro`. This board is designed to use hot swap sockets, so a broken switch is easily replaceable and low profile Choc switches.

### LEDs

For the LEDs there are 4 `SN74HC595N` shift registers, because there are not enough pins to control them individually. The sift register pins SRCLR are also pulled up high to not reset the storage, but also connected to gpio so we can still use them if we want to.
The LEDs are connected in a way, where the shift register sinks the current on the cathode, while the anode is permanently
connected with 330Ω to the 5V Raw pin on the MCU. There are also 4 break-out pins, so the leds can be tested either with buttons or an external MCU.

### Optional
- Optionally you can use [pin sockets](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Female-Headers_HCTL-PM254-1-13-Z-3-0-C_C5159941.html) for the MCU, so it is not directly solder onto the keyboard
