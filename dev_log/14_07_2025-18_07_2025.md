## Soldering first prototype
While some of the parts have already arrived, we are still waiting for the LEDs and other passive components. In this time, the components we have, which are the hot-swap sockets, diodes and some shift registers from previous projects were soldered onto the PCB.

The pins for the liatris controller have also been soldered.

## First software
To test whether the keyboard was working. We decided to insert the keys into the hot swap sockets and try to load javelin onto the board. We followed the steps in the [javelin-steno-pico](https://github.com/jthlim/javelin-steno-pico?tab=readme-ov-file#using-javelin-steno-pico-with-your-own-hardware) repository. The new config file can be found in this repository or using [this link](https://github.com/gradesta/readable-steno/blob/main/config/readable_steno.h). We managed to get the keyboard to output steno data and after using the javelin steno tools found [here](https://lim.au/#/software/javelin-steno-tools), under the script tool we could edit the characters of individual keys. Now the board can be used as a traditional steno input device and the focus will start to shift to reading data from the computer.
